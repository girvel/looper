`looper` is a configuration fileâ€“driven cron-style manager for reoccuring tasks. You can even accomplish your one-time tasks with it: you create an entry "do your one time tasks from your todoist" for "0 0 4 * * Sun *" and all your todos magically get done!

## TL;DR usage

Displaying the schedule:

```bash
looper show

```

## Configuration file example

Use `looper path` to get the path.

```toml
# next ID is 03

[daily]  # any text
period = "0 0 3 * * * *"  # cron-like syntax
00 = "make the bed"  # in format <id> = <full text>
01 = "take vitamins"

[two_days]
period = "0 0 3 * * * *"
02 = "water the plants"
```

## Installation

Clone the repository, cd into it, run

```bash
cargo install --path logic
```

## Recommended practices

- alias "looper" as "lp" for frequent use
- keep the ID for your next task in the configuration file header comment
- stow + git for configuration management
