# Looper â€” routine manager

`looper` is a personal task manager for reoccuring tasks, aiming to be as minimal & undercomplicated as possible. Basically a single TOML schedule (with TOML itself doing most of the heavy lifting) and small CLI frontend. `looper` has these goals:

- exercise low software complexity
- be as pleasant as possible to motivate own usage

## TL;DR usage

Displaying the schedule:

```bash
looper show
```

```
[5] Today is 09-Nov-2024:
#1d  clean the room
#0e  clean the toilet
#13  clean the windows
#0d  clean reflective surfaces
#0c  water the plants

Upcoming:
#0a  dust cleanup  @10-Nov-2024
#01  journal  @10-Nov-2024
#23  wash sweats  @10-Nov-2024
#1e  touch grass  @10-Nov-2024
#02  change of bedsheets  @15-Nov-2024
#15  change of towels in kitchen, bathroom  @15-Nov-2024
#1a  maintenance workout  @18-Nov-2024
#04  change lenses  @18-Nov-2024
#21  buy groceries  @01-Dec-2024
#18  clean the water heater  @01-Dec-2024
...16 more
```

Completing tasks:

```bash
looper done 1d 0e 0c
```

## Configuration

Schedule is set in single TOML file. Use `looper path schedule` to get the path. The sections are cron expression strings, defining frequency of the following routines; each key-value pair is a single routine: the key is a globally unique ID (any string that would be comfortable to use; I prefer two-digit hexadecimal numbers), the value is a full description.

```toml
# today
["0 0 3 * * * *"]
0a = "[today] practice swordcraft"
0f = "[today] advance alchemic knowledge"

# sunday
["0 0 3 * * Sun *"]
00 = "[duty] journal tribe movements"
06 = "clean the dungeon"
```

See [example](/example). Note that `state.toml` is an autogenerated file.

## Usage

- Use `looper show` to show the upcoming routines
- Use `looper done ...` to mark tasks as finished (even in advance)
- A routine can be undone by `vi $(looper path state)` and removing the entry with needed ID; it is a rare situation, so I deliberately chose not to add another CLI command to keep simplicity

## Recommended practices

- aliasing common cases in bashrc/zshrc file:

```bash
alias lp='looper'
alias lpe='e $(looper path schedule)'
function lps() {
    old_path=$(pwd)
    cd; cd dotfiles_private
    git add && git commit -m "#" && git push
    cd $old_path
}
```

- keeping track of the next ID, naming sections, etc. via TOML comments
- stow + git for configuration management
